# UFOs

## Project Overview
This analysis was done to help Dana and other UFO enthusiasts research more into UFO sightings. By breaking the documented UFO sightings into a filterable table, researchers will be able to group sightings based on Date, City, State, Country, and UFO Shape.

## Results
Researchers on the page can use the filter table options on the left side of the page to further analyze the data. By typing in a City, State, Date, Country, or UFO Shape and pressing enter, the data presented in the table will filter itself to present the requested UFO incidents. A short description of the event is included as well. Users can input one filter or as many as they would like before pressing enter to query the results.
Below are some images walking through an example. Notice the different filters entered on the left and the change in data showing.

## Summary 
One major drawback in the current design is the lack of data from outside of the United States. 

I would look for other publicly available data sources to include in the analysis to help rule out other phenomenon. 
Two sources immediately come to mind:
- Weather data for that location, date, and time.
- Flightradar data showing the locations of planes, helicopters, etc in the area during each incident.

Both of these sources should have publicly available data, possibly in API format, possibly in a downloadable database.
